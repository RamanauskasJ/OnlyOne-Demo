# OnlyOne
I created a repository for a JavaScript demo game to test my game-making abilities using the Phaser3 framework. The demo is an RPG-style object-oriented game, and I designed it to have only one level since this is a practice project.

To run the project, open it in any IDE that can run JavaScript code and has a built-in browser server. Afterward, simply run the index.html file.
